## Directory Contents Overview

Within this directory, there are two distinct types of files denoted as `<model_name>.py` and `run_<model_name>.py`.

><model_name> = {nb3, fae, dynfo, orf3v, olvf, ocds, ovfm, auxnet, auxdrop} 

`<model_name>.py`: These files represent the modular implementation of methods described in respective academic papers.

`run_<model_name>.py`: These files functions as a wrapper over the modular file, facilitating the input of data and hyperparameters into the model. It then proceeds to extract and evaluate the results generated by the model.   

It is pertinent to note that for the OVFM model, we utilize the author's implementation which resides within the `/OVFM` directory. The `ovfm.py` file within this directory serves as a wrapper over the original code implementation.

>Note:  We have included the number of features as an input for the ease of coding. However, note that it is not required to do so.
