## Raw Data Transformation
Some of the data sets need to be cleaned and processesed before they can be used in the models for inference. Details of how to process those datasets are given below.

- Spamassasin
    - Download the files form the link provided and unzip them.  
    - Use the sctipt `Code\DataStorage\DataPreparation\data_spamassasin_conversion.py` to clean the data.
    - Modify the 'path' variable at line 13 to the path of the directory where the unzipped files are located.  
    - The data will automatically be saved in the appropriate directory.

- IMDB  
    - Download the files form the link provided and unzip them.  
    - Use the sctipt `Code\DataStorage\DataPreparation\data_imdb_conversion.py` to clean the data.
    - Modify the 'data_path' variable at line 10 to the path of the directory where the unzipped files are located.  
    - The data will automatically be saved in the appropriate directory.

- Diabetes_us  
    - After downloading the dataset from the provided link, follow the instructions at https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2014/781670/#supplementary-materials to prepare it for analysis

## Dataset Preparation
### Variable P
For synthetic datasets, we varied the availability of each auxiliary input feature independently by a uniform distribution of probability $p$, i.e., each auxilairy feature is available for $100p\%$. For more information about this, follow paper - Aux-Net (https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-30105-6_46)

## Files
To run the models, see `Code/main.py`. All the comparison models can be run from this.  
After running a model on a certain dataset, run `Code/read_results.py` to display and save the evaluation in csv format.

## Running the code

To run the models, change the control parameters accordingly in the **main.py** file and run
```
python Code/main.py
```
Example: To run  model `nb3` on `wpbc` dataset, with probability of available features 0.75, use the code below
```
python Code/main.py --dataname wpbc --probavailable 0.75 --methodname nb3
```
> Note: For `auxnet` , set either of `--ifimputation True` or `--ifdummyfeat True`, and for `auxdrop` set `--ifAuxDropNoAssumpArchChange True` (as these models were modified from their original implementation to support the absence of (previously required) base-feature)
```
python Code/main.py --dataname ionosphere --probavailable 0.75 --methodname auxnet --ifimputation True
```
or
```
python Code/main.py --dataname ionosphere --probavailable 0.75 --methodname auxnet --ifdummyfeat True
```
and
```
python Code/main.py --dataname synthetic --probavailable 0.75 --methodname auxdrop --ifAuxDropNoAssumpArchChange True
```
<hr>

To read the results and save them in .csv format, run **read_results.py** with appropriate control parameters.
```
python Code/read_results.py
```
Example: To read the results of `nb3` on `wpbc` dataset, with probability of available features 0.75, use the code below
```
python Code/read_results.py --dataname wpbc --probavailable 0.75 --methodname nb3
```
